# `zsh-hist`
* Fix your previous command by [pressing <kbd>Undo</kbd>](#added-undo-functionality).
* Edit your history with the [`hist` command](#command-line-syntax).

## Added Undo functionality
On any new command line, you can now press <kbd>Undo</kbd> to pop the last command from your
history into the line editor, letting you correct any mistakes you made before running it back.
Afterwards, the old command will no longer be found.

(Check with `bindkey` to see which keyboard shortcut is bound to `undo`. `zsh-hist` does not change
that.)

## Command line syntax

  hist [options] <action> [selection]
