# `zsh-hist`
* Fix your previous command by [pressing <kbd>Undo</kbd>](#added-undo-functionality).
* Edit your history with the [`hist` command](#hist-command-syntax).

## Added `undo` functionality
On any new command line, you can now press `undo` to pop the last command from your
history into the line editor, letting you correct any mistakes you made before running it back.
Afterwards, the old command will no longer be found in your history.

Note: `zsh-hist` does not change your key bindings. By default, Zsh binds [`undo` to `^_`, `^Xu`,
and `^X^U` in emacs mode and to `u` in vi command mode](
http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#index-undo). To define your own
key binding, add a line like [`bindkey 'YOUR_KEY_CODE' undo`](
http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#index-bindkey) to your `~/.zshrc` file.
